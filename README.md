# Trailers-Viewer-AndroidApp

Android application for watching movie trailers by using Firebase and Youtube API.

## Description

The app introduces a streaming service platform, where the end-user can have access to a group of videos that are stored on the server. The user can sign up or login with their credentials and access a wide array of movie trailers that are available in three categories for the moment: new movies, comedies, and action. After logging, the user is inside a session, where they can choose the trailer, they want to watch, by clicking on the poster of the movie, and a video player will accommodate their watching needs for the next minutes. The application offers the possibility to read more about the movie, the cast, save a movie to watch later and explore a variety of videos. 

## Getting Started

Tested on 6.8" screens with Android Api 24 and 30.

### Executing program
